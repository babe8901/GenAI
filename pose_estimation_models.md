There are several pre-trained AI/ML models for pose estimation that you can use. Here are some popular ones:

1.  **OpenPose**: Developed by Carnegie Mellon Perceptual Computing Lab, OpenPose is one of the most popular libraries for pose estimation. It can detect multiple body parts, including the body, hands, face, and foot keypoints. It's available for C++ and Python and can run on both CPU and GPU.
    
2.  **DeepLabCut**: This is a popular open-source toolbox for markerless pose estimation of animals (or humans) using deep learning. It's highly customizable and is designed for neuroscientists but can be used in other fields as well.
    
3.  **PoseNet**: Developed by Google, PoseNet can detect human poses in real-time on both mobile devices and in the browser using TensorFlow.js. It's easy to set up and use and provides a good balance between speed and accuracy.
    
4.  **MediaPipe**: MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework by Google that offers customizable ML solutions for various tasks, including pose estimation. It provides high-fidelity tracking of body landmarks.
    
5.  **AlphaPose**: Known for its accuracy, AlphaPose is a high-performance model that can handle real-time applications. It is developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.
    
6.  **HRNet**: High-Resolution Network (HRNet) is a recent advancement in pose estimation, offering high accuracy by maintaining high-resolution representations through the network. It is highly regarded in academic and research communities.
    
7.  **BlazePose**: Another model by Google, BlazePose is part of the MediaPipe framework and is designed for high-accuracy pose tracking. It is particularly well-suited for mobile applications.
    
8.  **DensePose**: Developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), DensePose maps all human pixels of an RGB image to a 3D surface-based representation of the human body. It is useful for applications requiring detailed body surface information.
    

These models are available in various frameworks and languages, with pre-trained weights to simplify their usage in different applications. If you have a specific use case or requirements, I can provide more detailed guidance on how to implement one of these models.
